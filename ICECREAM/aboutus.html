                <h1> OUR STORY</h1>

            </div>
            <!-- write me a very short simple story. how a group of 3 friends created a icecream shop and get sucessful in college early days in present tence like all 3 friends are telling the story -->
            <div class="story">
                We abc, xyz, pqr have always had a passion for ice cream. We used to make our own flavors in our college
                dorm room and share it with our friends. One day, we realized that we could turn our passion into a
                business. So, we decided to open an ice cream shop near our college campus.
                <br>
                <br>
                We started small, with just a cart and a few flavors. But word of mouth quickly spread and our
                popularity grew. We were soon able to open a brick-and-mortar store, and now we offer a wide range of
                flavors and toppings.

                <br>
                <br>
                I handle the finances, Jack is in charge of creating new and exciting flavors, and Sarah manages the
                front of the shop, making sure our customers have the best experience possible.
                <br>
                <br>

                We can't believe how successful our ice cream shop has become. It's all thanks to our love for ice cream
                and our hard work. We're so grateful to be able to share our passion with the world.
            </div>

            <div class="thankyou">
                "We're grateful to the world for embracing our love for ice cream <br> and supporting our dream, making
                it a successful reality."
